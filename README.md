## Difficulties

I struggled with this homework more than any homework. I finished changing tiles and players early on, but had difficulties figuring out how to compare winning combinations. I spent a long time trying loads and loads of different things to make it work, to very little success. I could get rows quite easily, but couldn't do diagonals or columns.
After a heavy hint to 2d arrays and finding out jQuery has an inArray function that lets you know what's in an array, I eventually got it this morning.

## Good things

I am so extremely happy that it actually works. I went to bed late last night worried I wouldn't be able to complete the homework. But through a bit of trial and error, realising you couldn't compare an array to an array only its contents, and using some nested ifs, it works.

I feel confident about changing things in the DOM as well, I finished those tasks fairly quickly.
